## Makefile
```
This Makefile rules are designed for RoboSat.pink devs and power-users.
For plain user installation give a look on README.md.


 make install   Installs RoboSat.pink in an editable mode (and few Python dev tools).
                So any further RoboSat.pink Python code modifications will be usable at once,
                throught either rsp tools commands or robosat_pink.* modules.

 make check     Launchs all tests, and tools doc updating.
                Do it, at least, before sending a Pull Request.

 make pink      Python code beautifier,
                as Pink is the new Black ^^

```
